As part of my **undergraduate teaching at Cambridge**, I created a website hosting a variety of online exercises for students to complete. Each exercise introduces a single performance analysis or MIR-adjacent concept e.g. **onset detection**, **beat tracking**. Students who took this course were on either the Music or Biomedical Sciences program, and typically had **no prior experience of coding or audio signal processing**, so the use of code is kept to a minimum (in favour of manual labelling, online calculators, and spreadsheets for data analysis).
