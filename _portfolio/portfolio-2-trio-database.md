The **Cambridge Jazz Trio Database**üéπüéªü•Å is a dataset composed of about 16 hours of jazz performances with associated onset and beat annotations created by an automated signal processing pipeline.

The database contains about **16 hours of audio** recorded between **1947‚Äì2015**. The annotations were generated by an automated signal processing pipeline: two source separation models [[1](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter), [2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs)] are applied to obtain **isolated stems** from every instrument in each recording, **event onsets are tracked** in these stems [[3](https://github.com/librosa/librosa)], and these onsets are **matched with the nearest quarter note** tracked in the audio mixture [[4](https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom)]. The pipeline was validated against an equivalent set of annotations generated by humans for 10% of the dataset, with an average *F*-score of .86.

All recordings consist of [jazz piano trios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_trio) ensembles and feature one of 10 different jazz pianists. In roughly half of recordings, the pianist was one of the top-10 most prolific and popular musicians in the piano trio format, identified through large-scale scraping of [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) and [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/api) data. In all other recordings, the pianist is [Bill Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans), widely acknowledged as one of the most influential jazz pianists of all time. 

This split enables models to be trained on both *multi-class* (i.e., **which pianist is it?**, using only the top-10 pianist recordings) and *binary* (i.e., **is the pianist Bill Evans?**, using all the data) classification problems.

Listen to the beats tracked in a performance of "*Emily*" (1970) by the **Bill Evans Trio** below:
