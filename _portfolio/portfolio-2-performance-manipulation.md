Anyone who has ever watched a group of people create music together knows that it often involves a great deal of interaction and communication between the performers. If we want to study exactly how this interaction works, we need to develop the appropriate tools. In this project, we developed a software platform that aims to facilitate innovative research into interactive music-making and, indeed, other forms of human communication.

When used in an experiment, the software operates in a manner similar to a conference call made on a telecommunication platform such as Zoom or Skype, albeit one where all of the participants are together in the same room. Two or more musicians are seated opposite from each other, with direct visual contact between them prevented through the use of a physical barrier. Instead, they communicate through a closed-circuit audio-visual system, consisting of a webcam, monitor, headphones, and musical instrument, each connected to an external computer running our software.

Participants in our experiments hear each other’s performance using headphones, with visual feeds from their partner’s webcam displayed on a monitor in front of them. At any point during a performance, the researcher may use our software to introduce a manipulation into these feeds. Manipulations currently implemented in the software include the addition of delay (or latency), echo, pitches (e.g., artificial ‘wrong notes’), and automatic face and body occlusion. Our software enables the researcher to manipulate the cues and signals that musicians use to interact with each other, and study the processes that underpin this interaction.
