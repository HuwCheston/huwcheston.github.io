Hi! I'm Huw, and I'm a PhD student at the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I'm interested in what computer modelling and large-scale data analysis can teach us about the ways in which humans create, understand, and engage with music and culture.

## Research

I use large-scale quantitative and computational methods to investigate systems of production and classification in music: how people make music together, and how the music that they make can be understood and categorised. Most of my previous work has focussed on [improvised music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation), especially jazz, where I have written on subjects including performer identification, style classification, and action coordination. My work draws on techniques from music information retrieval, audio signal processing, machine learning, data science, and corpus analysis. I am also interested in the development of reusable technologies and datasets that can be applied by researchers across a broad variety of domains relating to music and audio.

## Background

I received my MSt. and BA. from the [Faculty of Music at Oxford University](https://www.music.ox.ac.uk/), where I graduated from both programmes with the highest mark in my cohort. My MSt. study was fully-funded by a graduate scholarship from [Linacre College, Oxford](https://www.linacre.ox.ac.uk/).

## Music 

Alongside my academic work, I have worked sporadically as a music teacher, musician (guitar, bass, and electronics), and sound recordist. I've been lucky to play alongside or in support of acts including [*Clean Bandit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Bandit), [*Everything Everything*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everything), and [*Elliot Galvin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Galvin). You can listen to some of my playing on several of the recordings released by [JazzSoc Records](https://jazzsoc.bandcamp.com/), a record label I co-founded while at Oxford. My production showreel can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ccWNviTf4A&ab_channel=HuwCheston). Finally, I also maintain the blog [WallpaperJazz](https://wallpaperjazz.wordpress.com/), which contains my own transcriptions of various jazz improvisations and recordings.
