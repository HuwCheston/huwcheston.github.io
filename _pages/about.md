Hi! I'm Huw, and I'm a PhD student at the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I'm interested in what computer modelling and large-scale data analysis can tell us about the ways in which humans create and understand art, with a specific focus on music and audio.

## Research

I use large-scale quantitative and computational methods to investigate systems of production and classification in music: how people make music together, and how the music that they make can be understood and categorised. Most of my previous work has focussed on [musical improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation), especially jazz and freely improvised music, where I have written on subjects including performer identification, style classification, and action coordination. My work draws on techniques from music information retrieval, audio signal processing, machine learning, data science, and corpus analysis. I am also interested in the development of reusable technologies and datasets that can be applied by researchers across a broad variety of domains relating to music and audio.

## Background

I received my MSt. and BA. from the [Faculty of Music at Oxford University](https://www.music.ox.ac.uk/), where I graduated from both programmes with the highest mark in my cohort. I have also worked in a professional capacity as a music teacher, guitarist, and sound recordist, and have been lucky to play alongside or in support of acts including [*Clean Bandit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Bandit), [*Everything Everything*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everything), and [*Elliot Galvin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Galvin). You can listen to some of my work on the website of [JazzSoc Records](https://jazzsoc.bandcamp.com/), the record label I co-founded while at Oxford.
