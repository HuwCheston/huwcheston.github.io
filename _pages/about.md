I'm Huw, and I'm a PhD student at the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I'm interested in what large-scale **computer modelling** and **data analysis** can teach us about the ways in which humans **create, understand, and engage with music and art**.

## Research

I use large-scale quantitative and computational methods to investigate **systems of production and classification in music**: how people *make music*, and how the music that they make can best be *understood and categorised*. Most of my previous work has focussed on [improvised music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation), especially jazz, where I have written on subjects including *performer identification*, *style classification*, and *action coordination*. This work has drawn on techniques from music information retrieval, audio signal processing, machine learning, data science, and corpus analysis. I am also interested in drawing from these (and other) fields to develop **reusable technologies and datasets** that can be deployed by researchers across a broad variety of domains relating to music and audio. To find our more about my work, check out my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}publications) and [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}talks). 

My PhD research is supported by a [Vice-Chancellor's award from the Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/scholarships/vice-chancellors-award).

## Background

I received my MSt. and BA. from the [Faculty of Music at Oxford University](https://www.music.ox.ac.uk/), where I graduated from both programmes with the highest mark in my cohort. My MSt. study was fully-funded by a graduate scholarship from [Linacre College, Oxford](https://www.linacre.ox.ac.uk/). In between my masters and PhD, I taught for a year in the music department at [Kingswood School, Bath](https://www.kingswood.bath.sch.uk/). [Click here]({{ site.baseurl }}cv) to read my full CV.

## Music 

Alongside my academic work, I have worked sporadically as a **musician** (guitar, bass, and electronics) and **sound recordist**. I've typically worked in either contemporary classical or jazz styles, but am comfortable within most notated and improvised settings.

As a performer, I've been lucky to work with acts including [*Clean Bandit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Bandit), [*Everything Everything*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everything), and with members of [*Fires of London*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fires_of_London) and [*Dinosaur*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_(band)). Projects I've worked on have variously been funded by [Sound and Music](https://soundandmusic.org/) and [Arts Council England](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/). You can listen to some of my playing on several of the recordings released by [JazzSoc Records](https://jazzsoc.bandcamp.com/), a record label I co-founded in 2020 while a student at Oxford. In the past, I've studied guitar with [Chris Montague](https://chrismontaguemusic.com/) and [Stuart Ryan](https://www.stuartryanmusic.com/), and improvisation with [Jason Rebello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rebello) and [John Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Law_(musician)).

My audio production showreel can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ccWNviTf4A&ab_channel=HuwCheston). Finally, I also maintain the blog [WallpaperJazz](https://wallpaperjazz.wordpress.com/), which contains my own transcriptions of various jazz improvisations and recordings.
